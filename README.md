##Task-1: Basic Calculator in Python
###Description
The Calculator Performs more than basic arithmetic operations,such as Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication,Division,Squareroot,Fraction.
###Features of the Calculator
It has the following features:
1.Good graphical user interface built with Python Tkinter, nicely colored with mouse hover effects on button.
2.Other arithmetic operations, such as
-> x squared
-> inputing negative values (-x)
-> calculating decimal values
3.Displays zero by default and controls inputs and outputs. 
4.It stores the latest answer, enabling the user to refer to it for further calculations
'clear' and 'backspace' buttons and more
5.Accepts and control keyboard inputs:
Receives only 0-9 and the available mathematical symbols or signs from the keyboard; Esc works like clear, Backspace works like ←, '/' inputs ÷ on the screen.

##Task-2: URL Shortener
###Description
URL shortening services allow you to take a long URL and create a shorter, more manageable link that redirects to the original long URL. 
These services are commonly used to share links on social media platforms, in emails, or in situations where space is limited.
###Features
The code uses a random string generator to create short URLs. The code also stores the original URL and the short URL. This allows users to easily access the original URL by clicking on the short URL. 
The code is efficient and scalable, making it a good fit for a production environment.
###Library Used
pip install pyshorteners
